Love math and software programming using the latest thoughts and tools. 

Early in my career, spent a lot of time in embedded software development in 
C with all sorts of compilers, therefore also very much into simple board
computers like Raspberry Pi. 

Currently focusing on funtcional programming, spending most of time outside
of work on Nix, NixOS, Haskell, etc. Going to look into NixOps soon.

Use a lot of R (ggplot/tidyverse) at work, not as dedicated data engineer, 
but a data savy business strategist.
